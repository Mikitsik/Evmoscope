## What is the Metaverse?

[Before The Metaverse Legend:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0eeYC87sc) "...in the deep rough Cosmos there is the marvelous planet Evmos inhabited with cute and smart Evmosians. And every Evmosian has its own Hamanets to interact with any chains and its own Evmoscope  to carefully explore, examine and start the enigmatic beginningâ€¦"

Yeah, there is Metaverse with Evmosians who can play Metaverse only if he has Evmoscope and Hamanets with any Evmos address. Evmoscope is a game console and Hamanets is a key to playing Metaverse but at the same time, they're separate and independent apps.

## What is the Evmoscope?

Evmoscope Legend: "...there is an alien's blockchain browser that why it is so weird..."

Evmoscope runs like a game console to Metaverse P2Earn Game but the same time it is an independent app with vast functionality. It has at least three layers:

# Evmoscope layer one

Layer One allows any person to use [Evmoscope](https://evmoscope.stakebenefit.com/).

It has many Tabs with Lists of data:

  - EVM (contracts)
  - IBC Relayer (vouchers)
  - Transactions (types: cosmos, ethereum)
  - Blocks
  - Validators
  - Accounts

It is convenient to open a part of data at the same places as Dropdowns. And one can access the same data through any Tab. Is it weird as to Evmosian Browser? In addition to their own Search panel on each Tab?

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
