## What is the Metaverse?

[Before The Metaverse Legend:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0eeYC87sc) "...in the deep rough Cosmos there is the marvelous planet Evmos inhabited with cute and smart Evmosians. And every Evmosian has its own Hamanets to interact with any chains and its own Evmoscope  to carefully explore, examine and start the enigmatic beginningâ€¦"

Every Evmos address is eligible to play Metaverse. What one Evmosian should have got to play the Game is Evmoscope an alien blockchain browser (the game console) and is Hamanets an alien wallet (the key to the game console).
Evmoscope is an independent and separate app as so Hamanets do. At the same time, it could be bound to the particular wallet and start the Game.

## What is Evmoscope?

Evmoscope: "...there is an alien's browser that's why it is a little weird..."
Evmoscope has at least three layers:

### Evmoscope layer one

Layer One allows any person to use [Evmoscope](https://evmoscope.stakebenefit.com/).

It has many Tabs with Lists of data:

  - EVM (contracts)
  - IBC Relayer (vouchers)
  - Transactions (types: cosmos, ethereum)
  - Blocks
  - Validators
  - Accounts

It is convenient to open each part of data at the same place on Dropdowns. And one can access the same data through any Tab. Is it weird as to Evmosian Browser? In addition to their own Search panel on each Tab?

### Evmoscope layer two



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
