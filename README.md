## What is the Metaverse?

[Before The Metaverse Legend:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0eeYC87sc) "...in the deep rough Cosmos, there are the marvelous planet Evmos inhabited with cute and smart Evmosians. And every Evmosian has its own Hamanets to interact with any chains and its own [Evmoscope](https://evmoscope.stakebenefit.com/)  to carefully explore, examine and start the enigmatic beginningâ€¦"

Every Evmos address is eligible to play Metaverse. What one Evmosian should have got to play the Game is [Evmoscope](https://evmoscope.stakebenefit.com/) an alien blockchain browser (the game console) and is Hamanets an alien wallet (the key to the game console).
[Evmoscope](https://evmoscope.stakebenefit.com/) is an independent and separate app as so Hamanets do. At the same time, it could be bound to the particular wallet and start the Game.

## What is Evmoscope?

[Evmoscope](https://evmoscope.stakebenefit.com/): "...there is an alien's browser that's why it is a little weird..."
[Evmoscope](https://evmoscope.stakebenefit.com/) has at least three layers:

### Evmoscope layer one

Layer One allows any person to use [Evmoscope](https://evmoscope.stakebenefit.com/).

It has many Tabs with Lists of data:

  - EVM (contracts)
  - IBC Relayer (vouchers)
  - Transactions (types: cosmos, ethereum)
  - Blocks
  - Validators
  - Accounts

It is convenient to open each part of data at the same place on Dropdowns. And one can access the same data through any Tab. Is it weird as to Evmosian Browser? In addition to their own Search panel on each Tab?

### Evmoscope API

Back-end API is a high structured Ruby-on-Rails server that treats Big Data coming from blockchain databases. To quickly give to user data it has a layer that caches some data. The API has special algorithms for special reasons.

### Evmoscope Layer Two

This layer is available when the user connects his Hamanets to [Evmoscope](https://evmoscope.stakebenefit.com/). This layer is also known as "private" because of any Evmos addressability to play Metaverse. The user would have a personal area with many new functions to be available. The user would be allowed to pull in or pull out any Tabs he wants, any data on the mainboard showing. He would be allowed for instance to stake or swap any coins he wants due to full Evmos Core functionality. He would be allowed to perfect guides on how to build his own smart contract and how to implement it to the Evmos EVM, etc.

There is a button on the left side of [Evmoscope](https://evmoscope.stakebenefit.com/). When the user pulls on it the private area with many settings appears when all Tabs slide down to the left like a curtain.

### Evmoscope Layer Three

This layer is also known as "public". Some apps may ask users to KYC but only extremely manually users could approve the sending of their KYC IPFC storage data.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
